üõ†Ô∏è FLM Tool ‚Äì Fedora LEMP Multipress Installation Tool
FLM Tool (Fedora LEMP Multipress) is a simple, automated BASH script designed specifically for Fedora-based systems. It provides a fast and hassle-free way to set up a full LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MariaDB, PHP) with optional WordPress Multisite (Multipress) support, including smart health checks and SELinux compatibility fixes.

üîç What it does:
Installs and configures a complete LEMP stack on Fedora distributions

Enables or disables WordPress Multisite (Multipress) with a single toggle

Fixes common cookie errors when running multiple sites under WordPress Multisite

Handles SELinux context issues out-of-the-box

Includes a health check module to monitor and manage PHP services and server status

Ensures the server starts automatically on reboot

Designed for local development use cases (perfect for WordPress developers)

‚úÖ Why this tool?
Most WordPress LEMP tools are aimed at Debian/Ubuntu systems, leaving Fedora users without a streamlined option. I created and tested this tool on Fedora 42 Desktop, ensuring it works reliably in a typical developer environment.

üöÄ How to use
Just run the script in your terminal. It's easy, guided, and doesn't require deep Linux knowledge. After a reboot, your local server will be running automatically. If needed, re-run the script for quick access to the built-in health checker and management features.
